## Overview

**SentinelAI** is an open-source AI-assisted reconnaissance and intelligence framework designed to help penetration testers automate and accelerate the reconnaissance and enumeration phases of security assessments.

SentinelAI acts as both an **orchestrator for industry-standard security tools** and an **AI-powered analysis engine** that transforms raw scan output into structured, actionable penetration testing intelligence. Rather than replacing human judgment, SentinelAI amplifies it — surfacing critical findings, correlating vulnerabilities, scoring attack surfaces, and recommending targeted next steps.

```
[ Target ] ──► [ Automated Recon ] ──► [ Vulnerability Intel ] ──► [ Risk Scoring ] ──► [ Report ]

## Core Modules

### Automated Reconnaissance

SentinelAI performs multi-phase port and service discovery using Nmap as its primary scanning engine.

| Phase | Description |
|---|---|
| Full Port Scan | TCP/UDP scan across all 65,535 ports |
| Service Detection | Banner grabbing and service version identification |
| OS Fingerprinting | TCP/IP stack analysis for OS detection |
| NSE Script Scanning | Targeted Nmap Scripting Engine scripts for vulnerability detection |

```bash
sentinelai scan 10.10.10.5 --modules nmap
```

### Enumeration Assistance

Once services are detected, SentinelAI launches targeted enumeration modules appropriate for the identified attack surface:

**HTTP Enumeration**
Directory and file brute-forcing, technology fingerprinting, header analysis, and common vulnerability checks via Gobuster, ffuf, Nikto, and WhatWeb.

**SMB Analysis**
Share enumeration, null session testing, version detection, and known SMB vulnerability checks via enum4linux and CrackMapExec-compatible modules.

**FTP Security Checks**
Anonymous access detection, banner grabbing, permission analysis, and CVE correlation for detected FTP services.

**SSH Configuration Analysis**
Algorithm enumeration, key exchange inspection, weak configuration detection, and version-based vulnerability identification.

**Subdomain Discovery**
Passive and active subdomain enumeration via Amass and Subfinder, with DNS resolution and live host validation.

---

## Attack Surface Scoring

SentinelAI calculates a **composite risk score** for each target based on the severity and combination of detected findings. Scores are weighted by exploitability, exposure, and business impact potential.

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Attack Surface Risk Score: 8.1 / 10
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Contributing Factors:
  ✖  Exposed SMB (port 445) — publicly accessible
  ✖  Outdated Apache 2.4.29 — CVE-2021-41773 applicable
  ✖  Anonymous FTP access enabled
  ✖  Weak TLS configuration (TLS 1.0 enabled, RC4 cipher)

  Score Breakdown:
  ├── Network Exposure:      9.0 / 10
  ├── Service Vulnerabilities: 8.5 / 10
  ├── Configuration Weaknesses: 7.8 / 10
  └── Patch Posture:         7.2 / 10
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## Recon Pipeline

SentinelAI can execute a full, automated reconnaissance pipeline with a single command. Each stage feeds into the next, allowing scan results to inform subsequent modules.

```bash
sentinelai autorecon target.com
```

**Pipeline Stages:**

```
Stage 1 │ Port Scan            → Discover open ports across TCP/UDP
Stage 2 │ Service Detection    → Identify services and version strings
Stage 3 │ Vulnerability Scripts→ Run NSE scripts for known vulnerabilities
Stage 4 │ Service Enumeration  → Launch targeted enumeration per service
Stage 5 │ Vulnerability Intel  → Correlate CVEs and exploit references
Stage 6 │ Risk Scoring         → Calculate weighted attack surface score
Stage 7 │ Report Generation    → Produce structured findings report
```

Stages can be individually enabled, disabled, or re-ordered via configuration. Parallel execution is supported where stage dependencies allow.

---

## Tool Integration

SentinelAI orchestrates a suite of best-in-class open-source security tools. It handles invocation, output parsing, and cross-tool result correlation automatically.

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) | Port scanning, service detection, NSE scripts |
| [Gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) | Directory and DNS brute-forcing |
| [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) | Fast web fuzzing and content discovery |
| [Nikto](https://github.com/sullo/nikto) | Web server vulnerability scanning |
| [WhatWeb](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb) | Web technology fingerprinting |
| [enum4linux](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux) | SMB and NetBIOS enumeration |
| [Amass](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass) | Subdomain enumeration and DNS mapping |
| [Subfinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder) | Passive subdomain discovery |
| Metasploit RPC | Module suggestion via pymetasploit3 |
| Shodan API | Pre-scan passive intelligence |
| Nuclei | Web vulnerability template scanning |
| EyeWitness | Automatic web service screenshots |

Results from each tool are parsed into a normalized internal schema, deduplicated, and correlated to produce a unified picture of the target's attack surface.

---

## AI-Assisted Analysis

SentinelAI can optionally leverage an LLM backend to perform reasoning-layer analysis on scan results. When enabled, the AI module:

- Interprets detected services and configurations in the context of real-world penetration testing engagements
- Identifies logical attack chains across multiple findings
- Recommends targeted follow-up techniques, tools, and payloads based on the identified attack surface
- Flags unusual or noteworthy findings that rule-based engines may miss
- Generates plain-language summaries suitable for inclusion in client-facing reports

```bash
# Enable AI analysis (configure API key in ~/.sentinelai/config.yaml)
sentinelai autorecon target.com --ai
sentinelai analyze ./reports/target.com_latest/ --ai --depth thorough
```

AI analysis is entirely **optional and opt-in**. SentinelAI is fully functional without an LLM backend configured.

---

## Self-Learning Intelligence

SentinelAI includes a local intelligence layer that stores and indexes scan history. Over time, this enables:

- **Trend analysis** — Track how a target's attack surface changes between assessments
- **Baseline comparison** — Automatically highlight new findings relative to prior scans
- **Recommendation tuning** — Weight enumeration suggestions based on historically productive techniques for similar service profiles
- **Environment pattern recognition** — Identify recurring misconfigurations or technology stacks across engagements

All data is stored locally in a structured SQLite database and never transmitted externally.

```bash
# View historical scans for a target
sentinelai history show target.com

# Compare two scan sessions
sentinelai diff target.com --from 2024-01-10 --to 2024-03-15
```

---

## Reporting

SentinelAI generates professional, structured reports from completed scan sessions.

### Supported Formats

| Format | Use Case |
|---|---|
| HTML | Interactive browser-based report with collapsible sections |
| PDF | Client-ready report for formal deliverables |
| Markdown | Version-control-friendly format for internal documentation |
| JSON | Machine-readable output for pipeline integration and tooling |

### Report Contents

Every report includes:

- **Executive Summary** — Risk score, critical finding count, and high-level assessment
- **Open Ports & Services** — Detailed table of discovered ports with version and banner data
- **Vulnerability Findings** — CVE IDs, CVSS scores, exploit references, and remediation notes
- **Configuration Weaknesses** — Service-level misconfigurations and hardening recommendations
- **Attack Surface Risk Score** — Weighted score with contributing factor breakdown
- **Recommended Testing Steps** — Prioritized list of follow-up penetration testing actions

```bash
# Generate report for a completed scan
sentinelai report target.com --format html
sentinelai report target.com --format pdf --output ./deliverables/
```
